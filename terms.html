            Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire

          </p>
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall
            the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,
            indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not
            limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other
            information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of

            even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or
            limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages,
            which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In
            these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest
            extent permitted by law.
          </p>

          <h3>"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</h3>

          <p>
            The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with
            all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum
            extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own
            behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective
            licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties,
            whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to
            the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability,
            fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and
            warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of
            performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the
            foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and
            makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your
            requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work
            with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate
            without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards
            or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be
            corrected.
          </p>

          <p>
            Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the
            company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind,
            express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the
            Service, or the information, content, and materials or products
            included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or
            error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of
            any information or content provided through the Service; or (iv)
            that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or
            on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan
            horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
            warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a
            consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may
            not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations
            set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
            enforceable under applicable law.

            affect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such
